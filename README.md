# STC-1000-Arduino-Temperature-Controller
STC-1000 Style temperature controller
This system uses a arduino board with NTC temperature sensors and a VGA video module(OctaPentaVeega board) to display the data on a VGA monitor.
Built this unit control a ice maker to cool my K40 laser engraver.
Found it to works very well.

Menu setup for parameters:
"Set Temperature?" 
"Set Temp Swing ?"
"Set Comp Delay ?"
"High Temp Alarm?"
"Low Temp Alarm ?"
"Min Flow       ?"
"Door           ?"
"Buzzer         ?"
"Alarms         ?"
"EXIT           ?"
